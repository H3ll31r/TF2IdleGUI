Never use your main Steam install, else you risk corrupting your game files.\r\n\r\n* Copy the Steam folder (minus the steamapps folder) to somewhere else on the hard disk.\r\n* Create a folder inside the Steam folder for each account you have.\r\n* Copy the steamapps folder somewhere (Do not use your main Steam installation's steamapps folder). You can delete all the non-TF2 related gcfs from this folder.\r\n* Open cmd.exe as an administrator, and for each idle account enter (using my directories as an example): `mklink /d \"G:/Sandboxie/Steam/Account1/Steamapps\" \"G:/Sandboxie/Steam/Steamapps\"` where the first parameter is the idle account's Steam install, followed by `/Steamapps`, and the second parameter is your secondary steamapps folder (Again, not your main Steam installations steamapps).\r\n\r\nYou should now have a folder structure similar to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nG:\\Sandboxie\\Steam:\r\n    Account1\r\n        ...\r\n        Steamapps\r\n        ...\r\n    Account2\r\n        ...\r\n        Steamapps\r\n        ...\r\n    Account3\r\n        ...\r\n        Steamapps\r\n        ...\r\n    Steamapps\r\n```\r\n\r\n* This tricks programs into thinking the steamapps folder is present in each of those account folders.\r\n\r\n## Sandboxie\r\n\r\nThe free version of Sandboxie limits you to one sandbox, meaning you can only run two instances of Steam at any one time (one unsandboxed and one sandboxed). To create more sandboxes you will require a license.\r\n\r\nCreate a sandbox for each of your folders, with whatever name you want to give them - I name mine the same as my folder names (so just Account1, Account2, Account3...).\r\n\r\nFor each sandbox right click on it and go to sandbox settings. You'll want to set the settings as follows:\r\n\r\n* `Restrictions` -> `Drop Rights` -> Untick `Drop rights from Administrators and Power Users groups`\r\n* `Resource Access` -> `File Access` -> `Full Access` -> Add your idle accounts Steam folder, and your steamapps folder.\r\n  * e.g. `G:\\Sandboxie\\Steam\\Account1`\r\n  * `G:\\Sandboxie\\Steam\\Steamapps`\r\n\r\n## First launch / what to do after every TF2 update\r\n\r\n* Run TF2Idle.py\r\n* Select 'Update GCFs' to copy the TF2 GCFs from your main Steamapps folder, to your secondary Steamapps folder\r\n* Select 'Empty sandbox' to delete any contents in each sandbox, this prevents errors.\r\n* Start Steam.exe from the secondary directory **unsandboxed** to make sure the GCFs are completely updated.\r\n* You are now ready to idle.","name":"TF2Idle","google":"UA-33267256-1"}
